> ### About this repository
>
> **This is not our API.** This repository is an independent, third-party profile of a company's
> **publicly available** API surface, maintained by [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com).
> API Evangelist does not operate, host, resell, or support this company's APIs, and is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by the company unless stated on the profile.
>
> **Where the information came from.** Everything here is assembled from material a member of the
> public can reach with a browser and no credentials — the company's own website, developer portal
> and documentation, the specifications it publishes for public use (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema,
> `apis.json`, `llms.txt` and similar), its public repositories, and its public status, pricing and
> changelog pages. **Nothing here is obtained by breaching a system, defeating an access control, or
> using credentials of any kind.**
>
> **The rating is an independent assessment.** The Kin Score and Agent Readiness rating are
> independently calculated scores of a company's *public* API artifacts, produced by API Evangelist
> against a published rubric. They are not certifications, endorsements, security assessments, or
> audits, and they score published artifacts — not the quality, safety, or security of the software.
>
> **Corrections, re-scores, and removal are free.** No partnership, contract, or purchase is
> required, and you do not need to justify the request.
>
> - **Something wrong?** Open an issue on this repository, or email
>   [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com).
> - **Published something new?** Ask for a re-score and we will re-run the rating.
> - **Want the listing taken down?** Say so and we will honor it. The profile is reduced to your
>   company name, a factual description, and a link to your own site, and the company is recorded as
>   **unrated** — never scored zero for having asked.
>
> **Response times.** Acknowledgement within **one business day**; removal or restriction within
> **two business days**; corrections and re-scores within **five business days**.
>
> **On a security or compliance team?** Email
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) with *security* in the subject line and
> you will get a person, not a form. We will tell you exactly which public URLs this profile was
> built from so your team can see the same surface we did, and we will take the listing down on
> request while you work through it.

Mammoth Brands is the consumer packaged goods company formerly known as Harry's Inc., renamed in
April 2025 to reflect a portfolio spanning Harry's, Flamingo, Lume, Mando and Coterie.

There is no developer programme, no portal and no OpenAPI. What there is — and it is real — is an
agentic-commerce surface on the two brands that run on Shopify:

- **Harry's** — anonymous MCP server at `https://www.harrys.com/api/mcp` (5 tools, protocol
  `2025-06-18`) and a UCP merchant profile at `/.well-known/ucp.json` (version `2026-04-08`).
- **Flamingo** — the same MCP surface at `https://www.shopflamingo.com/api/mcp`, plus a published
  `llms.txt` and `agents.md`.
- **Harry's + Flamingo** — Shopify Customer Account API OIDC / RFC 8414 discovery documents served
  from their own apex domains.
- **Lume, Mando, Coterie** — no agent surface.

No A2A agent card, `security.txt`, status page, changelog, SDK, CLI or Postman collection exists on
any Mammoth Brands host as of 2026-07-31.
